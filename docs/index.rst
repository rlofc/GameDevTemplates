The C++ Game Development Templates Library
==========================================

What is it?
-----------

The Game Development Templates (GDT) is a minimal game 
development toolkit written mostly as a set of generic modern C++ templates.

Built for freedom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GDT was designed to allow easy switching between different libraries for 
graphics, audio physics and other game backends.
While still being work-in-progress, GDT currently supports GLFW or SDL, OpenGL,
OpenAL and Bullet physics. Vulkan and Newton support is coming soon, followed
by the yet to be chosen network backends.

Here's how you specify a GDT application with a set of changable backends:

::

    using my_game = gdt::application<
        gdt::platform::sdl::backend_for_opengl,
        gdt::graphics::opengl::backend,
        gdt::audio::openal::backend,
        gdt::physics::bullet::backend,
        gdt::no_networking,
        gdt::context
    >;


Soon you would be able to change this set completely,
**without changing other parts of your game code**:


Built for coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In GDT, your C++ code is your main game modeling environment.
Any other tools are considered peripherial. You will use standard C++
constructs to model your game assets, materials, scenes and animations.
You choose your editor or IDE, you choose your project structure and 
everything is visible and controllable:

::

    struct zombie {
        my_game::model model;
        my_game::shader::material material;
        my_game::animation walk,
                           attack,
                           die;
    };

We also try to prefer structuring things in compilation time rather than runtime.
This is done through using templates, static polymorphism, CRTP and other nasty
tricks. The general idea is that it's faster to parse through a compiler's error
message (even ones involving templates) than debugging a misbehavior in runtime.

Built for tomorrow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GDT is using modern C++, applying smart techniques where it makes sense,
while holding back from over-using the language where it isn't.

Built for you
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GDT prefers your code readability on the expense of its inner complexity.
Game developers should be able to read their code easily, without parsing
through forced and obscured code constructs. GDT tries to follow this guideline
as much as possible.

For example, here's how you will set up a deferred rendering pass in GDT:

::
    
    deferred_shader.use(ctx)
        .set_pov(_camera)
        .set_lights(_lights_rig)
        .draw(_graveyard)
        .draw(_zombie)
        .draw(_hero);

Call for help
-------------

GDT is far from being ready. It needs people like you who
share the vision of having templates-based C++ game engine and who can
submit pull requests with cool new features, sample code or documentation
improvements. No contribution is too small!
